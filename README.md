# EfficientCostminiMizazionforElettricalEnergyDemand
Here the source of the codes for the Sperimental Analysis of the paper.
In the file *algorithms.py*, the 6 combinatorial algorithms are implemented.
To execute the code it is necessary to set the desired parameters in the file *run* and run the file.
To ensure the proper execution of the code, make sure that the solver Gurobi is installed.
